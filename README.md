Bash Network Scanning Tool

This Bash script is designed to perform basic network scanning tasks on target devices. It utilizes common tools like `nmap` and `metasploit-framework` to scan for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on specified IP addresses.

## Prerequisites

- **Root Privileges:** The script requires root privileges to execute certain commands like updating packages, installing software, and performing network scans. Ensure that you run the script with superuser privileges.

- **Dependencies:** Before running the script, make sure that `nmap` and `metasploit-framework` are installed on your system. If not, the script will attempt to install them using `apt-get`. 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (`network_scanner.sh`) onto your system.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script in your terminal.

3. Make the script executable if needed:
chmod +x network_scanner.sh

4. Execute the script with root privileges:
sudo ./network_scanner.sh

Copy code

5. Follow the prompts:
- Enter the IP address of the target device(s) you want to scan.
- Confirm whether you want to proceed with the scan.

6. The script will then perform the following actions:
- Update package lists.
- Upgrade installed packages.
- Install `nmap` and `metasploit-framework` if not already installed.
- Scan the target device(s) using `nmap` to identify open ports and services.
- Check for vulnerabilities on the target device(s) using `nmap` scripts.
- Open a new terminal window and launch `metasploit-framework` for further analysis and exploitation.
